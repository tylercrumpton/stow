S.T.O.W is laptop wireless card based on the Synapse SM200 SNAP module, a microcontroller with built-in 802.15.4 wireless meshing that runs Python scripts. It allows you to have a bridge node built into a laptop without having to carry a separate USB device around that sticks out from a USB port!

**NOTE**: This design has not been tested and is currently for illustrative purposes only. If you'd like to check out the design, you're good, but don't expect to send this off to a fab house and get a working board!
